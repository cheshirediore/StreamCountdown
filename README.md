# StreamCountdown

Current Version: 0.0.1

This application aims to provide a completely free, open source, relatively lightweight countdown tool for streamers. Once completed, you can use it as a Game Capture source in OBS (or equivalent in other streaming software) to display a countdown timer in your stream. The original inspiration was to create a "Starting Soon" screen for my Twitch stream (https://www.twitch.tv/cheshirediore). If you use this for your stream, credit is appreciated but not required.
