# StreamCountdown

Current Version: 1.0.0

This application aims to provide a completely free, open source, relatively lightweight countdown tool for streamers.

At the current version, you can use it as a Game Capture source in OBS (or equivalent in other streaming software) to display a countdown timer in your stream. The UI is extremely minimalist, with only a few fields for the countdown duration input and a start button. I want to add a cleaner UI and the ability to customize the countdown clock appearance in future versions.

As a minimally viable product, this is being designated as version 1.0.0, but it is far from a clean production environment build. If you encounter any issues, or have suggestions, please submit an issue on GitHub. That said, I provide no guarantees of future updates or bug fixes.

The original inspiration was to create a "Starting Soon" screen for my Twitch stream (https://www.twitch.tv/cheshirediore). If you use this for your stream, credit is appreciated but not required.
